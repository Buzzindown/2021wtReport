            &emsp;&emsp;Dear reader, by the end of this post I hope that you're able to understand the ins and outs 
            of my work at Phenom and the cool projects I worked on, as well as all the great things that I 
            learned! I'll get more into my role later, but as a brief introduction I started my work at Phenom 
            on a small team of three people (myself included) working as a frontend developer in React. I 
            received a MacBook Pro as my work laptop prior to starting and joined my team for my first day on 
            May 1st, 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>
            &lt;About-Phenom/&gt;
        </h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Phenom or Phenom People as it's also referred to is a SaaS startup founded in 2011 and 
            based out of Philadelphia. The company offers a unique recruiting solution that's based 
            heavily on AI/ML algorithms which can allow companies to recruit faster than ever, while
             sourcing the top talent available. Phenom offers various services from fully fledged 
             recruiting sites hosted by Phenom to smaller scale solutions to help out existing hiring
              structures.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Phenom was founded by two brothers and their goal is "To help a billion people find the 
              <b>right</b> job." I appreciate that they truly believe in this goal, it's not just a 
              marketing statement. Every quarterly global meeting they place a large emphasis on finding 
              the right job, because people are more productive and happier when they're in a role that 
              fits them. Another cool fact about the company, which I was unaware of at the start of my 
              internship is that they're considered a tech "unicorn" with a 1.4 billion dollar valuation 
              in 2021. The CEO plans to take the company public in the near future. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              &emsp;&emsp;The last neat thing I'll add about Phenom is their desire to be "not normal" the company embraces
               that we're all unique and have strange experiences or characteristics and that those shape who 
               we are. Everyone who joins the company must do a "not normal" presentation during their 
               introduction week, usually on the weekly all hands meetings with 50-200 people on the call. 
               You basically present a few things that are unique or weird about you, this is a really cool 
               low-stress opportunity to learn about your coworkers and I think it really brings teams together.

               <br/>
               &emsp;&emsp;The slide I used for my presentation is down below and my "not normals" consisted of: 
               being close friends with a deer growing up, having dual citizenship, being an automotive 
               photographer and liking pineapple on my pizza!

            &lt;Goals/&gt;
        </h2>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Let's talk about what I wanted to get out of this work term. Having had no experience 
        with react and minimal js practice prior to this internship, I didn't have super specific goals 
        about what technologies I wanted to learn and focused more on soft skills and other aspects. 
        That being said, I did learn a lot of tech and I'll get into that in the reflections section.
        I also had quite a few goals so I'll focus mainly on the ones that were particularly important 
        to me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Goals for the first half of the work term 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Become better at communicating ideas. Specifically while coding, I wanted to 
                improve my ability to have a clear and understandable conversation about problems 
                and solutions.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Seek more in depth answers, part of working at Phenom was to be curious and I really 
                wanted to embrace that. Getting full answers instead of just what I needed would 
                improve my understanding of that topic.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Improve my tech literacy. Part of describing problems and solutions is to use the right 
                terminology so that everyone knows what you're talking about. I found myself using 
                non-specific words like "this" or "that" or "thing" and that's not super useful
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Develop more creative solutions. Obviously there's best practices and ways that work better 
                certain things, but I wanted to start thinking outside of the box more, while still offering
                    an optimal/well thought out solution to problems.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Goals for the second half of the work term</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Become a more well rounded leader. I think part of being successful in general is 
                being able to lead, and I wanted to improve my ability to take initiative and lead 
                by example.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Get better at estimating time requirements for tickets and other requests, as well 
                assessing how I can improve my completion times while still producing quality work.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Continued improvement on creative thinking and problem solving.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;These goals gave me a good roadmap of specific areas to improve on over the course of my 
        work term. After about the first week and a half of work, one goal that I developed for 
        myself was to try and become more acquainted with CSS. During the first week it became 
        clear to me why many frontend devs truly hate the jumbled mess that CSS has become. However, 
        I realized that I wasn't going to be able to escape working with styles as a frontend dev so 
        I wanted to sharpen my skills over the term and become a CSS wizard.
