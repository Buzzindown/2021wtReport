        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Dear reader, by the end of this post I hope that you're able to understand the ins and outs 
            of my work at Phenom and the cool projects I worked on, as well as all the great things that I 
            learned! I'll get more into my role later, but as a brief introduction I started my work at Phenom 
            on a small team of three people (myself included) working as a frontend developer in React. I 
            received a MacBook Pro as my work laptop prior to starting and joined my team for my first day on 
            May 1st, 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>
            &lt;About-Phenom/&gt;
        </h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Phenom or Phenom People as it's also referred to is a SaaS startup founded in 2011 and 
            based out of Philadelphia. The company offers a unique recruiting solution that's based 
            heavily on AI/ML algorithms which can allow companies to recruit faster than ever, while
             sourcing the top talent available. Phenom offers various services from fully fledged 
             recruiting sites hosted by Phenom to smaller scale solutions to help out existing hiring
              structures.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Phenom was founded by two brothers and their goal is "To help a billion people find the 
              <b>right</b> job." I appreciate that they truly believe in this goal, it's not just a 
              marketing statement. Every quarterly global meeting they place a large emphasis on finding 
              the rightÂ job, because people are more productive and happier when they're in a role that 
              fits them. Another cool fact about the company, which I was unaware of at the start of my 
              internship is that they're considered a tech "unicorn" with a 1.4 billion dollar valuation 
              in 2021. The CEO plans to take the company public in the near future.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              &emsp;&emsp;The last neat thing I'll add about Phenom is their desire to be "not normal" the company embraces
               that we're all unique and have strange experiences or characteristics and that those shape who 
               we are. Everyone who joins the company must do a "not normal" presentation during their 
               introduction week, usually on the weekly all hands meetings with 50-200 people on the call. 
               You basically present a few things that are unique or weird about you, this is a really cool 
               low-stress opportunity to learn about your coworkers and I think it really brings teams together.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               &emsp;&emsp;The slide I used for my presentation is down below and my "not normals" consisted of: 
               being close friends with a deer growing up, having dual citizenship, being an automotive 
               photographer and liking pineapple on my pizza!

            &lt;Goals/&gt;
        </h2>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Let's talk about what I wanted to get out of this work term. Having had no experience 
        with react and minimal js practice prior to this internship, I didn't have super specific goals 
        about what technologies I wanted to learn and focused more on soft skills and other aspects. 
        That being said, I did learn a lot of tech and I'll get into that in the reflections section.
        I also had quite a few goals so I'll focus mainly on the ones that were particularly important 
        to me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Goals for the first half of the work term
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Become better at communicating ideas. Specifically while coding, I wanted to 
                improve my ability to have a clear and understandable conversation about problems 
                and solutions.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Seek more in depth answers, part of working at Phenom was to be curious and I really 
                wanted to embrace that. Getting full answers instead of just what I needed would 
                improve my understanding of that topic.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Improve my tech literacy. Part of describing problems and solutions is to use the right 
                terminology so that everyone knows what you're talking about. I found myself using 
                non-specific words like "this" or "that" or "thing" and that's not super useful
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Develop more creative solutions. Obviously there's best practices and ways that work better 
                certain things, but I wanted to start thinking outside of the box more, while still offering
                    an optimal/well thought out solution to problems.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Goals for the second half of the work term</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Become a more well rounded leader. I think part of being successful in general is 
                being able to lead, and I wanted to improve my ability to take initiative and lead 
                by example.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Get better at estimating time requirements for tickets and other requests, as well 
                assessing how I can improve my completion times while still producing quality work.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Continued improvement on creative thinking and problem solving.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;These goals gave me a good roadmap of specific areas to improve on over the course of my 
        work term. After about the first week and a half of work, one goal that I developed for 
        myself was to try and become more acquainted with CSS. During the first week it became 
        clear to me why many frontend devs truly hate the jumbled mess that CSS has become. However, 
        I realized that I wasn't going to be able to escape working with styles as a frontend dev so 
        I wanted to sharpen my skills over the term and become a CSS wizard.
        </p>

            &lt;My-Job/&gt;
        </h2>
        <div id="project-one"></div>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;This is the part where I get to tell you about all the cool stuff
             that I did. Let me get into the job situation a little bit more before I 
             continue. For starters, almost all of Phenom's development teams are based 
             in Hyderabad, India. This meant a 10 and a half hour time difference which 
             was interesting to say the least. I started work everyday at 5am, took an 
             hour-long "lunch" at around 9 and got my Tim Hortons then went back to work 
             until roughly 1pm. It was tough for the first week but I actually loved this 
             schedule because it allowed me to do more with my afternoons and evenings. 
             I'll go over the three projects I got to work on briefly down below.
        </p>
        <h3 >
            Project One - Job Feeds Tool
        </h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;At the start of my term, my team consisted of me, a senior developer named
            Harsha and a manager named Lakshmi. The team was freshly formed within the
             two weeks before my arrival and was tasked to create an internal tool to
             Improve ticket times regarding the changing of âjob feeds.â I'll be honest 
              here, I still don't entirely understand the whole picture of this. Just that
             companies would link their job postings to Phenom via XML feeds, and from 
              there Phenom would collect statistics and run algorithms to improve
             the visibility/click/apply rate for those jobs. The issue at the time
              was that these feeds were constantly being updated by customers, and
               support would have to go into a DB and manually update them, this 
               led to ticket times of a month or more for a simple change.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               &emsp;&emsp;The first two weeks of the project were essentially just 
               planning and deciding what sort of tech we wanted to use. We opted to 
               use redux for state management, redux sagas for middleware management 
               surrounding API calls (with Axios) as well as react router. This was cool 
               to me because these technologies are super popular and a key part of the 
               react ecosystem.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;We got some rough designs and they called for a drag and drop 
                functionality. For that we used react-dnd. I was actually the guinea pig 
                for this functionality and was asked to seek out and test some options so 
                we could choose the best one. The other main option was react-beautiful-dnd 
                (which is react-dnd with super slick animations and a slightly different API), 
                but it was a little bit more complex so we opted for the simpler unanimated 
                react-dnd. After the third week we had another member join the team. Her name 
                is Preethi and she would become our backend developer working with Mongo and 
                Spring boot.
                <br/>
                <div id="project-two"></div>
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;I'm trying to keep this short as I really could go on about all 
                the cool stuff we did and problems we ran into over the course of the project 
                but I think Iâll stop there. I would love to share the final designs as it came 
                reat but those are confidential. Eventually the project went on to our internal 
                customer support team who used it and loved it. Then it was flipped over to customers 
                self service tool, that required some improvements like user roles and such but it was 
                well worth it as ticket times had effectively been eliminated for feed changes.
        </p>
        <h3 >
            Project Two - Micro Frontends
        </h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;This was a crazy cool project to get to work on as micro frontends as a 
            concept is neat, and being able to implement and develop an actual project surrounding 
            is awesome. As a quick catch up for the reader, micro frontends are based on the idea 
            of micro services. The idea of micro frontends is to split up features logically so 
            that they can be managed by independent teams. The teams develop their feature 
            end-to-end from database to the user interface, they're also responsible for 
            deployment. This means that you can have multiple projects' on one page, each one 
            could be made with a different stack. Hopefully you can appreciate how cool and 
            potentially powerful this idea is.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Anyhow, the gist of the project is that Phenom has all of its tools in 
            this one place, where customers or internal support can access tools to change stuff 
            regarding products and settings. Our goal was to make a copy of this place but convert 
            it so that everything was running as a bunch of micro frontends rather than links to 
            multiple monolith frontends. During this time our senior developer became busier 
            trying to navigate creating and managing a devops pipeline for the first project. 
            So I was the one who got to experiment with micro frontends, before we started any 
            actual development. For about a week I got to mess around with the tool we used,
            âsingle-spaâ which is a javascript router for frontend microservices. I read a bunch 
            of documentation and eventually got an angular app, and two react apps to run on the
             same web page. By being the one to experiment with it, I gained a ton of in depth 
             knowledge on how the routing worked and a bunch of other niche topics. I've Included 
             an image that I drew up during a meeting that I used to help explain and reiterate 
             some ideas about how the project was going to work.
        </p>
        <div class="rect-img-container">
            <img src="media/designo1o1.jpeg" alt="design page">
        </div>
        <div id="project-three"></di>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;To also keep this one short, devops for this project was a bit rough as we had to coordinate 
            lots of stuff with other teams. Unfortunately our team didn't have a dedicated devops engineer 
            so Harsha (senior dev) had to learn and implement all of the pipeline tools quickly, and he did 
            a great job. Eventually we got to the point where we could test our tool out by hosting our first 
            project on it, and from there over the course of the rest of my work term we added other team's 
            tools on as micro frontends. Overall I think this was my favorite project, because the technologies 
            behind it were super neat and I felt like I really understood everything that was going on. Also, 
            halfway through this project we had another junior frontend developer join our team named Shiva and a 
            backend developer named Charu. So at this point we were up to six people!
        </p>
        <h3 >
            Project Three - Category Mapping
        </h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;This project was similar to the first project in the sense that the goal was to create a tool to 
            minimize or entirely eliminate ticket times for a specific problem. A little introduction here, 
            Phenom maintains internal job categories that it uses to organize the jobs coming from customers' 
            career sites. So for one Phenom job category, there may be 10 jobs under it from the customer's site. 
            The way that these are âmappedâ influences a lot of things in the Phenom ecosystem and the mapping is 
            constantly changing. Similarly to the first project, the change requests had to be done manually and 
            were very slow leading to super long ticket times.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;This project started about a month before the end of my work term and I was asked to develop a minimum 
            viable product, essentially a rough but functional tool. The goal was to create solid foundation code, 
            not focus a lot on the user interface and make something that would be easy for my team to take over 
            once I was gone.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;This was great for me as it was an opportunity to demonstrate what I had learned, as well as my ability 
            to get work done efficiently and effectively. I started off by roughly copying the file structure of the 
            first project so that it would look familiar and files could be found easily. From there I reviewed the 
            designs I was given and considered what technologies to use, and reviewed this with Harsha and Lakshmi. 
            We opted to basically keep the same technology, but get rid of redux sagas as we felt we weren't using it 
            in a meaningful way and that we'd be better off with basic inline axios calls to the APIs. After we 
            agreed on that I went to work.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;During the daily standups I would update the team and give a little demo of where I was at, and if I ran 
            into any issues or had questions this was also the time to share those. After about two and a half weeks 
            I had created a rough looking, but functional tool. Over that time span I ran into issues surrounding 
            documentation for API calls, styling and a few changes in the UI which were all resolved in short order. 
            Now that I had created the project, Shiva joined me to bring the UI up to spec and during that last week 
            we grinded out a good looking and fully functional project.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Halfway through this project we had another frontend dev join us named Richards, and during the last week 
            I worked we had a senior (10 YEO) developer join the team named Sanga. It's crazy to consider we started 
            with three people and were now up to eight and growing quickly.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;My last two days were spent handing off my knowledge to Richards and Sanga. I walked them through the code 
            for the three projects and pointed out areas of improvement, and stuff that was well done as well as 
            answered any questions they had regarding functionality or the code itself.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;I was also asked to continue working part time despite my internship ending and will be rejoining the team 
            after Christmas break some time in mid January, that was great news for me! The last thing I did at 
            Phenom was join the Canadian team for a nice dinner in the GTA, here's a photo of (almost) all of 
            the Canadians at Phenom.

            &emsp;&emsp;Now that you've read about all the cool things I got to work on, how did I do regarding my goals and 
            general improvements as a developer. To start, I think I improved a lot on my technical lingo and 
            being able to communicate ideas and solutions. During daily standups I had to get good at articulating 
            my ideas and problems using the correct terminology. This greatly improved my communication abilities.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Next, I found I didn't have to work too hard to get in-depth answers. Because the work was so interesting, 
            it felt sort of natural for me to keep digging deeper and reading further into problems and answers until 
            I understood them really well. Therefore I would say I improved slightly on that aspect as well, albeit 
            without putting too much thought into it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;The final project really brought out the leader in me, I had to sort of rise to the occasion and take the 
            initiative. Being successful in that project reinforced that hard work + critical thinking can get you a 
            long way. Starting solo on it meant that I had to take the initiative and suggest changes and technologies 
            and really take control of it, and it felt great to get it done.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Finally, I think being a frontend dev allowed me to flex my creative muscles a lot. It's nothing like 
            writing C all day long and having one or two ways to do something. The frontend allowed me to come up 
            with a bunch of solutions, sift them down to the best and then choose from there. The flexibility of that 
            was awesome and I enjoyed being able to come up with multiple valid solutions.

            &emsp;&emsp;Overall, I would say this work term had a steep learning curve but was super rewarding. I put a lot of 
            effort into making good decisions and writing quality code and was rewarded with more responsibility. 
            I also learned a lot of technology and skills that will help me get further into the frontend side of 
            development.

            &emsp;&emsp;To conclude, I started off with minimal knowledge in the frontend and some ambitious goals for the term. 
            Over the eight months, I learned an incredible amount of technology and also greatly improved my soft 
            skills. My team was awesome and the projects we worked on have proven to be valuable to the company. 
            I completed many of my goals and plan to continue to improve on them and reach new heights. It was truly a 
            great work term!
